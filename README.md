# T.E.D.D. The Efficient Delivery Driver

### Project Purpose

I delivered food at Wawa's first test store. I noticed quickly that we were not sending drivers out on deliveries in the most efficient way possible. Customer tips were visible to the drivers before hand, and deliveries were often delegated to provide an even amount of tips to drivers and not delegated with the customer's satisfaction in mind. We also did not know exactly how long each delivery was, we only saw an overview and we were to "eyeball" the most efficient routes. What delivery should we take out first? What drivers should be given what deliveries to ensure they are back in the store the fastest? These are the types of questions that I seek to answer with this project. 

### Project Description

The end goal of this project is to create a simulation that tests different strategies for delegating delivery drivers on their routes to see what is the most efficient. 

For example, say we have only one driver available for a shift. Is it most efficient to send them out on deliveries as soon as possible? Or would it be better to have them wait 15 minutes after the first delivery to see if more will come in? If they wait they could save time by taking two orders out at once. 

The simulation will keep track of statictics like average delivery times, driver utilization, total distance traveled, etc.
